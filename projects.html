<h1>My Programming Projects</h1>
<p>This year during our CSP course we enganed in multiple projects which revolved around making projects/games with code. We used many sites but my favorite website was Microsoft Makecode Arcade as it was interactive and let my creative juices flow. Over the year we did a few projects but my favorite project was my Zombies game which was my Create Task for College Board. The reason I loved this project so much was that it was my original work and I finally got to show what I learned all year through an interactive project. Allthoguh I did other projects like Space Invader and Monkey Chaos none of them compares to my Zombies game. I loved creating thorugh code this year and the projects we created in CSP allowed us to show our creative thinking.</p>
