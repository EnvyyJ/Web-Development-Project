<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Jeremiah Cooper and I will be discusing the unique things about me. I am a student at Phillip O Berry Academy of Technology and they specialize in developing their student in technology. I am a 10th Grader and I am taking Computer Science Principles a class on were we learn about code and collaborate with other students using code. I love partaking in this class because of the many concepts we learn and I enjoy collaborating with other students. Though I strive to be an excellent student trying to keep my 4.3 GPA and improving on it. I am dedicated to my academics but academics isn't the only thing I enjoy, I like to play golf, watch and analyze sports with my friends, and play video games although I have taken a little break from games as I focus on my future. As I grow up, I would love to be either a Software Developer or a Hedge Fund Manager because through my 15 years of life these two careers have peaked my interest. As life went on I always loved using technology whether that be to help others or to just have fun and I loved games, so I wondered how do you make games. You make games through coding and during my teenage years the concept of coding has peaked my interest and I will keep coding so I can become more skilled in this skill. I wanted to become a Hedge Fund Manager because of the events during quarantine and my interest in stocks during this time. During quarantine, I watched various informational videos on stocks and I reaserched different news on stocks and this lead me to want to have a career in Hedge Fund Management. I am learning and as I grow up in this world I want to learn and expiernce new things so I can grow as person. This is about me Jeremiah Cooper.</p>
